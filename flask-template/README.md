# Flask Template

This sample repo contains the recommended structure for a Python Flask project. In this sample, we use `flask` to build a web application and the `pytest` to run tests.

 For a more in-depth tutorial, see our [Flask tutorial](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask).

## Running the Sample

To successfully run this example, we recommend the following VS Code extensions:

- [Python](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.python)
- [Python Debugger](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.debugpy)
- [Pylance](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-python.vscode-pylance) 

- Open template repo
- Create a Python virtual environment using the **Python: Create Environment** command found in the Command Palette (**View > Command Palette**). Ensure you install dependencies found in the `requirements.txt` file.
- Ensure your newly created environment is selected using the **Python: Select Interpreter** command found in the Command Palette.
- Run the app using the Run and Debug view or by pressing `F5`.
- Navigate to the Test Panel to configure your Python test or by triggering the **Python: Configure Tests** command from the Command Palette.
